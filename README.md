# Requirements

Taken from https://gist.github.com/ryanpierre/971c0fc456acf38ae012bc0c7d54bc9b#file-superplanner-md

Your job is to make a todo list application. This is no ordinairy to do list though. It's a super planner ! Here is a quick feature list we are hoping to implement:

- [ ] Add, Edit, and Delete Todos 
- [ ] Mark Todos as complete
- [ ] See a list of completed todos and uncomplete a todo
- [ ] See the current weather and date
  
Implement all of the following user stories to bring the SuperTodoList to life ! I'd recommend that you use the following stack to create this project:

- Ruby on Rails backend with a React frontend (created using create-react-app)
- Express Backend with React frontned (created using create-react-app)

Make sure your app is fully tested. This includes testing your frontend components in addition to unit tests and feature tests in the backend !

You might find the following page useful in getting started if you've chosen Rails:

[Using Rails for API only application](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html)

For the purpose of this excercise, we don't want to render views in Rails. Instead, we should return JSON data from each request, and consume that JSON data in our React frontend.

When you're running your app, you should have two terminals open: One, running rails, and the other, running your react app. Don't worry about running them on the same port and ignore tutorials which might tell you to do this.

You might find this helpful as well if you've chosen to use Express or Rails:

[Proxying requests from React to your backend](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development)

For implementing the weather, try using [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). You'll need to sign up but you only need the free tier.
